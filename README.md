**Project Summary: Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Analysis with Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla**

This repository hosts an extensive Excel-based analysis that applies the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to evaluate the performance of three titanic stocks in the technology and automotive sectors: Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla. These stocks are compared against the S&P 500 index to discern their relative performance and adherence to CAPM principles.

**Objective:** 
The primary objective of this project is to understand the practicality of CAPM in determining the expected return of stocks while considering the systemic risk posed by market fluctuations. The analysis aims to showcase the strength of Excel as a powerful tool for portfolio management and financial analysis.

**Data Source:**
Historical data for stock prices and volumes from 2018 to 2023 were sourced from Yahoo Finance. This data forms the backbone of the analysis, providing a comprehensive view of the market dynamics and individual stock performances over the period.

**Tools and Methods:**
The project employs various Excel features and analytical techniques such as:
- Regression analysis to estimate the securities' beta values.
- Descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendencies and dispersions of stock volumes and price changes.
- Visual representations including line charts, scatter plots, and pie charts to compare and contrast the movement of individual stocks with the S&P 500.

**Findings:**
The analysis provides insights into each stock's beta, indicating its volatility in comparison to the market. Additionally, it reflects on how each company's stock reacts to market movements, thus providing a clearer understanding of each stock's risk profile and investment suitability as per CAPM.

**Conclusions:**
This repository not only presents the findings of the CAPM analysis but also serves as a testament to the capabilities of Excel in handling sophisticated financial models. It is an exemplary resource for finance professionals, academic researchers, and investment enthusiasts interested in the practical application of investment theories.
